## HR ANALYTICS DASHBOARD
I’m excited to share my latest project an HR Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI. This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition, helping HR teams uncover patterns and make data-driven decisions to improve retention. By visualizing attrition across various factors such as age, education, salary slabs, and job roles, the dashboard highlights key insights that can shape workforce strategies. Developing this project strengthened my skills in data visualization, analytical thinking, and storytelling with data.
I believe tools like this play a crucial role in enhancing organizational performance and employee satisfaction.
I’d love to hear your feedback or suggestions on how this can be further refined!
